# rjb_phd_paper1_code
Code (and notebooks) directly relating to my 1st PhD paper.

Stored elsewhere: 
 - ERA5 and AWI Sea Ice Portal data
 - Model code and output

The sea ice data was accessed from AWI's HTTPS server at https://data.meereisportal.de/data/iup/hdf/s/. If this doesn't work, try the IUP's server at https://data.seaice.uni-bremen.de/amsr2/. 

ERA5 data was accessed using the CDS API client Python package. See `cds_request.py` for example usage.
